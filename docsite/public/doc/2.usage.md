# Usage

## Initialization

First, you need to create a new instance of `PromptTemplate`. You can do this by providing either the name of the template to load or an instance of `LmTemplate`.

```typescript
const tpl = new PromptTemplate('alpaca'); // Loads the 'alpaca' template
```

## Cloning Templates

You can clone an existing `PromptTemplate` instance to create a new one with the same settings. This is useful when you want to work with a copy of the current template without modifying the original one.

```typescript
const clonedTpl = tpl.cloneTo('chatml'); // Clones the current template to the 'chatml' template
```

## Converting to JSON

You can convert the current `PromptTemplate` instance to a JSON object. This is useful for storing the template or transmitting it over a network.

```typescript
const json = tpl.toJson();
console.log(json);
```

## Manipulating System Blocks

You can replace or append messages to the system block, which contains instructions or context for the assistant.

### Replacing the System Block

```typescript
tpl.replaceSystem('You are a JavaScript expert'); // Replaces the system block with a new message
```

### Appending to the System Block

```typescript
tpl.afterSystem('You are a JavaScript expert'); // Appends a message after the system block
```

## Manipulating Prompt Blocks

You can replace the `{prompt}` placeholder in the user message with a new message. This is useful for customizing the prompt dynamically.

```typescript
tpl.replacePrompt('fix this invalid json:\n\n```json\n{prompt}\n```');
```

## Adding Shots

Shots represent user-assistant interactions and can be added to simulate multi-turn conversations.

### Adding a Single Shot

```typescript
tpl.addShot('Is it raining?', 'No, it is sunny.'); // Adds a single shot
```

### Adding Multiple Shots

You can also add multiple shots at once. Each turn is represented by an object with `user` and `assistant` properties.

```typescript
tpl.addShots([
  { user: 'What is the weather like?', assistant: 'It is sunny today!' },
  { user: 'What is the weather like tomorrow?', assistant: 'I am sorry, but I can\'t predict the future.' }
]);
```

## Rendering Templates

You can render the template into a string representation. This is useful for generating the final prompt that will be sent to the language model.

### Basic Rendering

```typescript
const rendered = tpl.render();
console.log(rendered);
```

### Rendering with a Specific Prompt

You can also render the template with a specific message replacing the `{prompt}` placeholder.

```typescript
const prompted = tpl.prompt("list the planets in the solar system");
console.log(prompted);
```

## Pushing to History

You can push a turn into the history of the template. This is useful for maintaining a conversation context over multiple interactions.

```typescript
tpl.pushToHistory({ user: 'What is the weather like?', assistant: 'It is sunny today!' });
```

## Handling Tool Calls

If your template supports tools, you can add and process tool calls.

### Adding a Tool

```typescript
const tool = {
  name: "WeatherFetcher",
  description: "Fetches weather information.",
  arguments: {
    location: { description: "The location for which to fetch the weather." }
  }
};
tpl.addTool(tool);
```

### Processing an Answer with Tool Calls

```typescript
const answer = '{"name": "WeatherFetcher", "arguments": {"location": "New York"}}';
const result = tpl.processAnswer(answer);
console.log(result);
```

## Encoding Tool Responses

You can encode tool responses to be included in the conversation.

```typescript
const response = { location: "New York", weather: "Sunny" };
const encodedResponse = tpl.encodeToolResponse(response);
console.log(encodedResponse);
```
